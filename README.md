**Giwa Auto Bot** is an advanced automation tool designed for seamless interaction with the Giwa Sepolia Testnet, an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) solution powered by the OP Stack and developed by Upbit/Dunamu. This bot facilitates asset bridging, smart contract deployments, NFT minting, and ERC20 token transfers, making it ideal for testnet exploration, development, and automated farming activities. With 1-second block times and high throughput, Giwa enables efficient Web3 infrastructure testing.

## üåü Key Features

- **Cross-Chain Bridging**: Automate ETH transfers between Sepolia (L1) and Giwa Sepolia (L2) with configurable amounts and delays.
- **Smart Contract Deployment**: Deploy Owlto contracts, ERC20 tokens via factory, and interact with GMONChain factories.
- **NFT Minting**: Efficiently mint OmniHub NFTs, with built-in balance checks to prevent redundant operations.
- **ERC20 Token Management**: Deploy custom tokens and send them to random or predefined addresses, with balance verification.
- **Randomized Operations**: Support for random bridging directions and target addresses to simulate diverse activity.
- **Full Automation Mode**: Execute a comprehensive workflow (bridging, deployments, minting, transfers) across multiple accounts.
- **Robust Monitoring**: Real-time logging with color-coded outputs, transaction hashes, block numbers, and direct explorer links.
- **Data Persistence**: Automatically save deployed token details to `tokens.json` for tracking and reuse.
- **Error Resilience**: Integrated retry mechanisms for RPC connections, transactions, and gas estimation.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Dynamically adjust transaction counts, ETH amounts, and inter-transaction delays via an intuitive menu.

The bot supports multi-account processing from a secure input file, ensuring scalability for batch operations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Core Framework**: Python 3.12+ with asyncio for asynchronous, non-blocking operations.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Web3.py for Ethereum RPC interactions, contract calls, and transaction signing.
- **Account Management**: eth-account for secure private key handling and address generation.
- **HTTP Client**: aiohttp with timeouts and BasicAuth for reliable API calls.
- **User Interface**: Colorama for enhanced terminal output; pytz for timezone-aware logging (WIB/Asia/Jakarta).
- **Utilities**: tabulate for data formatting; json for persistent storage.

This setup ensures high performance and compatibility with standard development environments.

---

## üìã System Requirements

- **Runtime**: Python 3.12 or higher.
- **Dependencies**: Listed in `requirements.txt` (no internet required post-installation).
- **Network Access**: Stable connection to Sepolia RPC (Alchemy) and Giwa Sepolia RPC.
- **Testnet Funds**: Sepolia ETH from faucets (e.g., [Sepolia Faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com/)); Giwa tokens from [Giwa Faucet](https://faucet.lambda256.io/giwa-sepolia).
- **Hardware**: Standard CPU (multi-threading supported via asyncio); 512MB+ RAM recommended for multi-account runs.

**Important**: This tool is exclusively for testnet environments. Do not use with mainnet assets.

## üîß Installation Guide

1. **Repository Cloning**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/thekazuha787/Giwa-Auto-Bot.git
   cd Giwa-Auto-Bot
   ```

2. **Dependency Installation**:
   Create or verify `requirements.txt`:
   ```
   web3==6.15.2
   eth-account==0.10.0
   aiohttp==3.9.5
   colorama==0.4.6
   pytz==2024.1
   tabulate==0.9.0
   ```
   Install via:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configuration Files**:
   - **pv.txt**: Add private keys (one per line, optional label: `private_key:AccountName`).
     ```
     0xYourTestnetPrivateKey1:MainWallet
     0xYourTestnetPrivateKey2:SecondaryWallet
     ```
     *Security Note*: Store securely; never commit to version control.
   - **wallets.txt** (Optional): List target addresses for ERC20 transfers (one per line).
   - **tokens.json**: Auto-generated for tracking deployed tokens.

4. **Environment Setup**:
   - Ensure RPC endpoints are accessible (hardcoded: Alchemy Sepolia, Giwa Sepolia).
   - Fund accounts via testnet faucets.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Launch the Bot**:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
   The interface displays a professional banner and navigable menu.

2. **Interactive Menu**:
   - **1. Bridge Sepolia ‚Üí Giwa**: L1 to L2 deposits.
   - **2. Bridge Giwa ‚Üí Sepolia**: L2 to L1 withdrawals.
   - **3. Random Bridge**: Stochastic direction selection.
   - **4. Deploy GMONChain**: Factory interaction for chain deployment.
   - **5. Deploy Smart Contract (Owlto)**: Bytecode-based deployment.
   - **6. Deploy ERC20 Token (Factory)**: Custom token creation (prompts for name, symbol, decimals, supply).
   - **7. Mint OmniHub NFT**: Conditional minting based on ownership.
   - **8. Send ERC20 Random**: Transfer from saved tokens to targets.
   - **9. Set Transaction Count & Amount**: Tune settings (defaults: 1 tx, 0.0001 ETH, 1-3s delays).
   - **10. Auto All**: Sequential execution of options 1-8 for all accounts.
   - **11. Exit**: Graceful termination.

3. **Example Workflow**:
   - Select **10** for automation: Processes bridging (bidirectional), deployments (GMON, Owlto, ERC20), NFT mint, and ERC20 sends per account.
   - Monitor logs for Tx details and [Giwa Explorer](https://sepolia-explorer.giwa.io/) links.
   - Post-run: Review `tokens.json` for deployed assets.

**Pro Tip**: Use option 9 to optimize for gas efficiency and avoid RPC throttling.

## üîí Security & Best Practices

- **Private Key Handling**: Keys are loaded in-memory only; avoid logging or exposing them.
- **Testnet Exclusivity**: Validate all operations on testnets to prevent accidental mainnet use.
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in random delays (configurable) mitigate RPC bans.
- **Auditing**: Review contract ABIs and RPC URLs before use; update as networks evolve.
- **Backup**: Regularly back up `tokens.json` for continuity.
